FPL APP | Track your joy

How to use this app:
Everything is a means to joy. So joy is the king.
We say it three ways—feeling good, pleasure, and loving joy—to really ground it in.

On the left you’ll see the joy scale, from 0 to 10. That’s your visual compass.

Step 1: Describe your 10/10 joy life.
Since all is for joy, perfection = 10/10 joy, not just money, romance, or success.
Think of the real-life items that make up your personal heaven.
Hit “add 10/10 entry” for each one.

Step 2: Rate where you are now.
Based on your 10/10 list, ask: How close am I today? Maybe you're at a 3, 5, 8.
Enter that number on the scale.

Step 3: Add your “joy chores.”
These are the things that maintain or move your current level—
like brushing teeth, doing the dishes, going to the gym, finishing a task.
Tap “add joy chores”, and choose whether it’s daily, weekly, or once.

Step 4: Pick your Big Lever(s).
Now look again at your 10/10 list.
Which 1 or 2 items would make the biggest positive impact on your score if you focused just on them?
If you'd like, add a “+ number” after each (like +1.9), based on how much joy they'd add.
Tap the hammer icon to move them to the Big Lever section.
This is where you’ll focus most—just 1 or 2 items max.

Step 5: Lock it in.
Once everything’s entered, click each checkbox once to lock in the text and duration.
After that, checkboxes work normally:

In 10/10, checked = permanent + strikethrough.
In Now, one-time tasks disappear when done, recurring ones freeze until the next day/week.
You can always delete with the trash icon.

A note on growth:
Every time you hit a 9 or 10, it’s not “mission complete”—it’s a new horizon.
Each peak reveals a higher one, because joy gets richer.
Your 10/10 at age 5 isn’t your 10/10 now (no more HoHos and 20-hour video games, right?).
So: when you hit a high, re-evaluate. What’s your 10/10 today? Update your entries. Stay fresh. Stay real.
Some habits may stick around (like brushing your teeth), but joy itself evolves endlessly.
Joy has no ceiling.
